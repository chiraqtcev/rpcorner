Critters FRM Workshop 1.0 README
------------------------------------------------

Critters FRM Workshop is a multi-purpose Fallout2 FRM files Editor. With it you can : 

 - Create new Fallout2 critters FRM files from a Bmp collection (one bmp per frame)
 - Open, display and animate the Fallout2 critters FRM
 - Adjust your frames position with real time display of the changes you make.
 - Export single frames to bmp.
 - Batch Export all the frames at once to a folder.
 - Import new frames from Bmp images and replace existing frames.
 - Swap color palettes and display them.


This software should be useful to artists willing to Mod Fallout2 and create 
their own new critters. If you got an animated mesh ready for rendering in any 
3D soft you should be able to put together and fine tune a new FRM rather quickly

New FRM Creaction process: 
--------------------------
Use the Create new FRM button in the toolbar. Define the number of frames per Orientation,
provide a filename then multi-Select all the bmp files you wish to import in the new
FRM. The Bmp files should be named following an ordered pattern because they are put together
in the alphabetical order. ex : Myfrm0_01.Bmp; Myfrm0_02.bmp; Myfrm0_03.bmp.... Myfrm5_18.bmp.
Don't Forget to save your file as the creation process doesn't do it automatically.

Keyboard events : 
-----------------
While in Frame Adjustment mode you can use the up and down arrow keys to change the current 
frame displayed. Use Tab to validate your changes. Esc will toggle off Edit mode

Custom Palettes:
----------------
You can load custom color palettes at runtime with the palette menu. ACT (universal) or fallout2 PAL
(just Fallout 2 / not the same as the photoshop pal format) Formats are supported. If you give a
.pal palette the same name as an Frm and place them in the same Dir then Frm Workshop will automatically 
load and display the custom palette when you open your Frm (ex: MyFrm.pal with MyFrm.frm).

Actually i wanted to try and learn VB but i decided to realise this project instead of the 
classical Paint-like apps you get to do with the usual tutorials. I hope the fact that i'm a 
complete newbie to it doesn't show too much.
